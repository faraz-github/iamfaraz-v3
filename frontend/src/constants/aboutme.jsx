      Hi there! I’m Faraz, a web developer who loves designing modern,
      user-friendly websites. I’m also the founder of Scripted Threads, where I
      help people learn web development. <br />
      <br />
      I’m really passionate about delivering great results on every project.
      From simple sites to more complex builds, I enjoy the variety and
      challenges that come with each job. <br />
      <br />
      When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me out hiking, diving into a
      good book, or exploring new ways to improve myself. I’m always eager to
      learn and grow, both in my work and in my personal life. <br />
      <br />
      Feel free to get in touch if you’d like to work together or just want to
      chat!
